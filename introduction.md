## Share-Stuff

#### Introduction

- A first stab at explaining the Share Stuff service.

It is becoming increasingly clear that we will have to change our patterns of consumption. Neither earth, nor economy
can stand the current way we're doing things.

We need to become smarter about the purchases we make, and better at utilizing whatever resources we actually spend
money on. In short, we need to transform more of our resources into a
[sharing economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharing_economy).
The transformation has already begun and today there is no shortage of services for pooling or increasing the usage of
resources. But even though specialized services such as
[Uber](http://www.uber.se/),
[Snappcar](http://www.snappcar.se/) and
[Airbnb](http://www.airbnb.se/)
make it easy to share rides, cars and apartments, we believe that the true potential in the sharing economy lies in the
masses of unused stuff lying around. We believe that the sharing economy eventually will transform the way we live our
lives and that applications should be hyper-local and grow out of a community rather than being designed by a company. 

That is why we're building [Share Stuff](http://www.share-stuff.com/), a free platform for sharing things with your
friends. You can add anything to the service and make it available to anyone. The only restriction is that you're not
allowed to charge money for the resource. Money complicates everything so we'll tackle that use case a little later.
